An AI-based spam classifier is a computer program that uses artificial intelligence techniques, such as machine learning, to automatically identify and filter out unwanted or irrelevant messages, typically in the context of email, messaging apps, or other communication platforms. This classifier analyzes the content and various characteristics of incoming messages to determine whether they are spam or legitimate. It learns from past data and user feedback to continuously improve its accuracy in classifying and blocking spam messages, helping users to maintain a clean and organized inbox.
